  proposal:
    - text: Have you ever used something and wanted to know more about how it came to be, but this information was not readily available? 
            Our team members got together and realised that answering this question, with a focus on museums, can positively add to the user experience, 
            and help them appreciate their physical surroundings even more. If you walk into a museum today, all you're most likely to see are the installations it has. 
            But these installations were never just placed randomly. Someone, or even teams took time to carefully decide what went where, or what was fit to be included
            as part of the museum. Some of the pieces have been there from the start, while some have constantly been changed. This is an untold story, the museumâ€™s story, 
            which we think should be explored.
    - text: Solution - 
            Our team proposes developing a program that will work with any smart device, that is bluetooth or wifi enabled. The program will have a database that will contain 
            historical information about the museum itself, dating back to the earliest records available. Both visitors and stuff will be able to access information on how the 
            the galleries in the museum have changed over time. From the kind of installations the museum had, to their arrangement, down to what inspired the museum to make certain 
            changes. The kind of information they will have access to will change depending on which part of the museum they choose to explore. Users will be able to view this information 
            as a timeline for easy comparison between time periods of their choice. Think of it as the museum itself being an installation that the users can explore to help them better 
            understand the space they are in.

  contextual:
     - text: The people who would be interested in our design would be WCMA staff who are interested in expanding the number of 
            museum visitors and WCMA team members who want to provide a more meaningful experience for visitors. The WCMA staff 
            could use our design as a way of achieve that goal i.e. our design would provide the historical context of the space 
            for visitors thereby providing a new way of engaging with the space. On the flip side museum visitors would use our 
            design to learn more about the current space and its past. 
    - text: To learn about how to achieve the best design, in our contextual inquiry plan, we plan to observe how people currently 
            learn more about the space and what information they prioritize when learning about a space, both the past life of a 
            space and the space as it is now.

          Add personal revisions to Google Docs (contract and group proposal)

          Steve:
            Create the Github project page and share with others
            Write up group proposal and add to site

          Linda:
            (at Grace Hopper)
            Set up Google Docs
            Assist with contextual inquiry proposal and add to site

          Julia:
            Write up contract and add to site

    - title: Meeting management
      text: 'Meetings in person weekly scheduled through group chat (likely on weekends)
        Have a purpose for each meeting.
        Begin by recognizing good work accomplished.
        End with clearly assigning specific tasks and deadlines.'
    - title: Accountability process
      text: Primarily we will hold ourselves accountable for completing our assigned tasks within the given timeframe.
        Tasks will always be assigned with a date by which they should be completed. If a date is not specified, it is the responsibility of the assignee to follow up with the group to decide on a deadline.
    - title: Rewards and punishment
      text: We will celebrate our successes and recognize the work that brought us to that point, acknowledging the individual contributions of each team member.
        We will give each other critique never to tear each other down, but to build up our collective project.
        We will receive critique with an open mind and knowing that we are working to the same goal as our teammates.
    - title: Follow up
      text: We keep this contract as a living document to which any member of the team may bring up revisions at any time. Changes will be made upon approval by all members of the group.
